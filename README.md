Overview:

TechWise Seniors is dedicated to closing the digital gap for seniors over 65, who face significant barriers to internet access and would rely on it to assist them with booking doctor appointments, remaining in contact with family members especially if they reside in rural regions. 
Despite a reduction in non-internet users from 10.2 million to 5.3 million between 2011 and 2018, 10% of adults remain offline, with 79% of these being seniors. This digital exclusion denies them access to cheaper shopping, job opportunities, and essential services.

Key Barriers:
Elders often face multiple barriers to digital inclusion, including:
•	Disabilities
•	Rural isolation
•	Loneliness
•	Low income
•	Resistance to learning new technologies

Affected Groups:
The digital divide disproportionately affects:
•	Seniors, particularly those over 65
•	Rural residents with limited access to learning centers
•	Ethnic minorities such as Bangladeshi and Pakistani seniors
•	Individuals with disabilities

Case Study:
Haniya, a 73-year-old from Northern Ireland, embodies these challenges. She lives in a rural area with poor broadband, has severe arthritis, lives alone, and has limited English proficiency.

Proposed Solutions: 
TechWise Seniors proposes several initiatives to address these challenges:
1.	Pop-up Workshops: Local, hands-on digital literacy training.
2.	Educating Your Elders: Online courses for family-led teaching.
3.	Flyer Campaign: Informative outreach to offline seniors.

Pilot Program: 
The pilot involves small-scale workshops to gather feedback and refine the approach, with plans to expand based on the insights gathered and funding will come from corporate partnerships, government grants, and donations, with an estimated cost of £35 per participant per workshop.

Impact: 
By addressing the digital divide, TechWise Seniors aims to empower the elderly, promote inclusivity, and improve their quality of life, thus fostering social and economic benefits.
